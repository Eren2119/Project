<h2><b>Who we are</b></h2>

<div>
    <p>We are Karmachari Sanachaya Kosh (KSK), also known as Employees Provident Fund (EPF) in English. We manage Provident Fund (PF) in Nepal on behalf of the Government of Nepal (GoN) for government, public and private sector employees and come under Ministry of Finance.</p>
</div>

<p>We are an approved retirement fund of GoN, and the PF that we manage is supposed to help our contributors financially on retirement or separation from their jobs. Besides managing PF of our contributors, we also provide certain social benefits to our contributors.</p>

<p>Membership to KSK is also open to private sector firms with the only condition that such firms should have at least ten employees contributing regularly to become a member.</p>

<h2>â€‹<b>Our History</b></h2>

<p class="justifier">In Nepal, the history of Provident Fund (PF) dates back to 1934 when the PF scheme came into existence with the establishment of Sainik Drabya Kosh (Army Provident Fund) during the Rana Regime. The scheme was initiated with the intentions of removing financial hardships to the army personnel after their retirement. Under the scheme, the army staffs were required to contribute a specific percentage of their salary to their provident fund (PF) account in Sainik Drabya Kosh. A decade later the scheme was broadened to cover the employees of civil services as well.</p>

<p class="justifier">A separate organization named Nijamati Provident Fund was established in 1944 to manage the scheme for civil servants working within Kathmandu. In 1948 the coverage of the scheme was extended to provide coverage to the entire civil servants working through out Nepal. In 1959, Employees Provident Fund (EPF) Department was established under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs. This department was entrusted with the management of both Sainik Drabya Kosh and Nijamati Provident Fund. With this, the scope of the scheme was extended to cover all government employees including the police.</p>

<p class="justifier">Three years after the establishment of EPF Department, a special Act called "Karmachari Sanchaya Kosh (KSK) Act" was legislated in the year 1962. The same year the present KSK, or EPF in English, was established under the act as an autonomous provident fund organization.</p>

<p class="justifier">After the establishment of KSK the erstwhile Sainik Drabya Kosh, Nijamati Provident Fund and Provident Fund Department were merged into KSK. Since then KSK has grown by leaps and bounds and today it stands as a strong social security providing organization in Nepal.</p>

<h2><b>Members and Membership Base</b></h2>

<p class="justifier">Employees from state owned institutions attain automatic membership to KSK. These include personnel from the army and police, civil servants, state owned corporations, and government school and colleges.</p>

<p class="justifier">Around 25,000 offices contribute to Provident Fund and 500 offices are contributing to Pension Fund. The present membership base is 6,28,000 individuals (2020 - July data)</p>

<h2><b>PF Contribution Rates</b></h2>

<p class="justifier">The rate of PF contribution for all employees is ten percent of their salary, which is to be supplemented by an equal amount by the employer. The total PF contribution amount is to be sent to KSK on a monthly basis when salaries are prepared. The following table depicts the various rates of contribution at different times.</p>
